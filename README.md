=================

gocons.pl is a wrapper for ipmitool and Dell IPMI that:

- allows system administrators to remotely manage Dell servers that have IPMI configured using a text console
- stores the IPMI password so users don't have to type it for each command
- provides commonly-used options to ipmitool for better ease-of-use
- has comprehensize help.

gocons.pl has been extensively tested on Dell 1950 and 2950 servers.
